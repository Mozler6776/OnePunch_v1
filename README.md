# OnePunch_v1

#### Description
I made this tool to make my job easier in CTF competitions. It makes it easier to use other tools added to the software. You can get results in a short time.


#### Usage
Using onePunch is simple, pass a file or string to it as it's first parameter and optionally pass the path to a wordlist of passwords to try as it's second parameter.

```
# ./onepunch <file> [<wordlist>]
```
Or:
```
# ./onepunch 'string'
```

#### Installation
```
git clone 
```

```
gcc onePunch_v1.c -o onepunch
```
